- 👋 Hi, I have 8+ years of expertise in custom Python development with Django/Flask/Fast API/web2py/Sanic framework, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, AWS and extensive experience in Python/scrapping website, web portal, desktop application & ERP/CRM development. Strong background in web applications & API development, bots programming and browser automation solutions.

- 👀 I tend to be extremely straightforward about what I can do and how long it might take me to do it. I know my limits, and I try to break past them every single day.

- 🌱 I strive to find exciting ways both old and new to challenge myself in my quest to become a python and JavaScript Jedi master!

- 💞️ If you want success of your idea and your project and you are looking for full-time & dedicated python developer to develop user-friendly high-end functionality-based website, web application or ERP/CRM application,  please come to me.

- 👉Feel free to 💬 me. I'll be happy to work with you and help you to build your idea in the web world.

Regards!
